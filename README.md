#### Hello. This is an open-source project I created for anyone to use to post OpenSea sales for their NFT collection on Twitter and/or Instagram! Currently, I have the bots running for a few NFT Collections. Before I start explaining everything, I would like to note that the Instagram account is least preferable. There are many things that are challenging with the Instagram version. Most of these things reside in getting the API developer account itself, creating a Facebook page just to link the Instagram and post on it (it's required in their weird Graph API), trying to figure out how to use their API, etc. Well, their API isn't that hard to use but the Content Publishing feature (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/guides/content-publishing/) is quite new and there are not a lot of materials online to learn from.
